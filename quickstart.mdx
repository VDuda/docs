# Quickstart: Your First Steps with Nomad AI

Welcome to Nomad AI! This quickstart guide will walk you through the essential steps to get your business set up and begin leveraging the power of our Unified Economic Ecosystem.

<Info>
  This guide focuses on connecting your first revenue source. For a detailed list of all integrations, please refer to our [Integrations section](/integrations/overview).
</Info>

## Step 1: Set Up Your Organization

Before connecting any integrations, you'll need to create your organization within Nomad AI.

1.  **Log in to the Nomad AI App:** If you haven't already, visit [app.usenomad.ai](https://app.usenomad.ai) and sign in.
2.  **Create Your Organization:** Follow the on-screen prompts to set up your business organization (e.g., "My Brand LLC"). This will be your central hub for all financial data.

<Tip>
  Ensure your organization details are accurate, as these will be used for reporting and compliance.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Connect Your First Revenue Integration (e.g., TikTok Shop)

Connecting a commerce platform is the first step to feeding data into the Pilot engine.

1.  **Navigate to Integrations:** From your Nomad AI dashboard, go to **Settings > Integrations**.
2.  **Locate TikTok Shop:** Find the "TikTok Shop Integration" card and click the "Connect" button.
3.  **Authenticate:** A secure pop-up window will guide you through TikTok's official OAuth portal. Grant the necessary permissions for Nomad AI to access your sales data.
4.  **Confirm Connection:** Once authenticated, the pop-up will close, and the TikTok Shop integration card in Nomad AI will update to show "Disconnect," indicating a successful connection.

## Step 3: Initial Data Ingestion

Upon successful connection, Nomad AI immediately begins its work:

*   **Historical Data Backfill:** Our Pilot engine automatically starts fetching your historical sales data from TikTok Shop (typically the last 30-90 days), building an immediate financial baseline for your business.
*   **Dashboard Population:** You'll soon see your dashboard populate with charts and data, providing initial insights into your revenue.
