# The AI Refinery (Pilot Engine)

The **Pilot engine**, conceptually named **"The AI Refinery,"** is the central nervous system of Nomad AI. Its primary function is to ingest raw, chaotic data from various sales channels and refine it into structured, actionable financial assets.

## Key Features & Implementation

### Unified Ledger
We maintain a standardized ledger that consolidates all financial activities from diverse sources into a single, consistent record. This ensures a unified and reliable source of truth for your business's economic data.

### Automated Bookkeeping
Our AI-driven system intelligently tags and categorizes transactions (e.g., as Cost of Goods Sold, Marketing, or Operations). This automation streamlines your financial reporting, making Profit & Loss (P&L) generation effortless.

### Real-Time Data Ingestion
To provide the most up-to-date financial insights, the Pilot engine ensures continuous data flow:

*   **Instant Updates:** We capture revenue and transaction updates in near real-time, listening for events from integrated platforms as they occur. For more details on supported platforms, see our [Integrations Overview](/integrations/overview).
*   **Historical Context:** Upon connecting an integration, our system automatically fetches historical sales data (typically the last 30 to 90 days) to quickly build a comprehensive financial baseline for your business. The underlying [Integrations Service](/technical-architecture/integrations-service-backend) manages this process seamlessly.
