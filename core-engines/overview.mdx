# Nomad AI Core Engines Overview

Nomad AI is built upon a robust architecture powered by three autonomous core engines, collectively known as **The Trinity**. These engines work in unison, driven by our **"AI Refinery"** design philosophy, to deliver comprehensive financial intelligence and management capabilities for CPG and eCommerce businesses.

Each engine serves a distinct, yet interconnected, purpose:

*   **The Pilot (Operations Engine):** Refines raw data into structured financial assets.
*   **The Treasury (Yield Engine):** Maximizes capital efficiency through high-yield strategies.
*   **The Exit (Strategy Engine):** Prepares your business for future liquidity events from day one.

Together, they form a holistic system that transforms your business's financial data into actionable insights and strategic advantages.
