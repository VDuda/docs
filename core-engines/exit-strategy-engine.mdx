# The Exit Engine

The **Exit engine** embodies the philosophy of **"Hand over the keys, not the passwords."** It is meticulously designed to prepare your business for any future liquidity events, such as a sale or fundraising, by maintaining a perpetual "Due Diligence" state from day one.

## Key Features & Implementation

### Live Valuation Widget
Our platform provides a dynamic **Live Valuation Widget** that offers a real-time assessment of your business's worth. This calculator applies industry-standard valuation methodologies to the continuously updated financial data flowing from the [Pilot engine](/core-engines/ai-refinery-pilot), giving you an accurate and current picture of your business value.

### Virtual Data Room (VDR)
The Exit engine automatically constructs and maintains a **Virtual Data Room (VDR)**. This feature generates and organizes folders within integrated cloud storage solutions (e.g., [Google Drive](/integrations/google-drive), [Dropbox](/integrations/dropbox)), where crucial financial reports, legal documents, and operational data are securely archived on a monthly basis. This ensures that your business is always "due diligence ready" for potential investors or acquirers.

### Acquisition Marketplace
A sophisticated **Acquisition Marketplace** is integrated into the platform. This feature intelligently anonymizes your business's key performance metrics and presents them to a network of pre-vetted buyers and investors. This provides a streamlined and confidential pathway for exploring potential acquisitions or funding opportunities.
