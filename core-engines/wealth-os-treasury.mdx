# The Wealth OS (Treasury Engine)

The **Treasury engine**, known as **"The Wealth OS,"** is engineered to maximize capital efficiency for your business. It automatically routes idle cash into high-yield instruments, transforming your operational funds into actively growing assets.

## Key Features & Implementation

### Yield Ticker
Our interactive dashboard features a **Yield Ticker** that provides a real-time visualization of your capital growth. This component calculates and displays daily interest accrual based on your "Active Yield" balance, sourced from our high-yield financial partners.

### Instant Settlement
Nomad AI leverages sophisticated predictive models, informed by the data flowing from the [Pilot engine](/core-engines/ai-refinery-pilot), to advance payouts. This means you can access your marketplace earnings faster than traditional settlement cycles, significantly improving your business's cash flow velocity and liquidity.

### Multi-Currency Support (Roadmap)
Looking ahead, the Treasury engine is designed to seamlessly handle global revenue streams. Our roadmap includes efficient management of funds across multiple currencies, aiming to eliminate punitive foreign exchange (FX) fees and simplify international operations.
