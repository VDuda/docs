# Technical Architecture Overview

Nomad AI is built on a modern, modular, and scalable architecture designed to support a growing ecosystem of financial tools and integrations. Our platform combines best-in-class approaches to deliver a high-performance, secure, and resilient experience.

This section provides a high-level overview of our primary components and how they interact.

## Key Principles

*   **Microservices:** Functionality is broken down into smaller, independent services.
*   **Event-Driven:** Utilizes webhooks and messaging for real-time data flows.
*   **Data-Centric:** A robust data management layer serves as the single source of truth for financial data.
*   **Cloud-Native:** Designed for deployment on modern container orchestration platforms.
*   **Performance:** Optimized for speed and responsiveness at every layer.
