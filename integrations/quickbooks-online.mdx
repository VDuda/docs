# QuickBooks Online Integration

<Info>
  **Status:** 🟡 OAuth Only
</Info>

The QuickBooks Online integration provides a foundation for comprehensive financial data management. While the initial connection is fully functional, advanced data synchronization features are currently in development.

## Features & Implementation

*   **OAuth Connection:** A secure OAuth 2.0 flow enables you to connect your QuickBooks Online account. This process establishes the necessary authorization and tracks your QuickBooks `realmId` within Nomad AI.
*   **Planned Features (Roadmap):**
    *   **Two-Way Ledger Sync:** Future enhancements will enable seamless two-way synchronization of your general ledger data between QuickBooks and Nomad AI's unified ledger.
    *   **Automated Invoice Generation:** Automate the creation and reconciliation of invoices directly from Nomad AI's transaction data.

## Technical Details

*   Our [Integrations Service (Backend)](/technical-architecture/integrations-service-backend) manages the OAuth flow and token handling for QuickBooks Online.
